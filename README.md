# TREE
Develop a project for working with the search tree, containing the following handlers, which should:
- enter information from the array into the search tree;
– add a new entry to the search tree;
– find information by a given key and display it;
– remove information with the specified key from the search tree;
– print the information by direct, reverse traversal and in the order of key generation; Count the number of leaves in the tree (a leaf is a node from which there are no links to other nodes of the tree).
